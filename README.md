# AuCiGen-ABuGeR

Subject 5 of the geomatic project (TSI 2017) Follows https://github.com/arnaudgregoire/AuCiGenPart4

AuCiGen: Automated City Generation from DEM models 
ABuGeR: Automated Building Generation and Rendering from the parcels created in part 4.

ABuGeR (Automated Building Generation and Rending) creates from two separate polygon shapefiles (one corresponding to the roads end the other to the parcels) a 3D model of procedurally generated buildings. The parcels, roads and buildings are stored as Wavefront .obj files that can be automatically rendered in an OpenGL window after the program execution (using the EAGL project). The models are also readable using the Blender 3D software.
